# üìåKanban

Kanban is a visual methodology used to manage projects, offering a clear view of task progress on a virtual board. In our project, it was used to control the workflow from idea to completion. The table has columns representing different stages of the process. Each task is represented by a card that moves between columns as it progresses. Allowing a clear view of the status of each task, making it easier to identify possible problems and plan the next steps.

## How each column works in Kanban

### üÜï New
    In this column, we record Issues without complete detail. We haven't done the description and priority mapping yet. They wait to be evaluated and prioritized before being moved to the next step.

### üìã Backlog
    The Issues in this column have been prioritized and have priority mapping, but have not yet been voted on for difficulty. They wait for the availability of resources or the completion of other activities to move forward.


### üìù Ready
    Here, the Issues were noted in detail, mapped, voted on and judged important for the current Sprint. They are ready to go and all the necessary resources are available.


### üöÄ In Progress
    At this stage, Issues are being actively worked on. Each team member can sign off on a task, even if they are just studying about it. If for some reason the task cannot be completed, it can be returned to the Ready column.

### üîç In Review
    The Issues in this column have been completed and are undergoing a final review before acceptance to be merged into the dev branch. This is important to ensure the work meets established standards and requirements.
 
### ‚úÖ Done
    In this final stage, the Issues were finalized, reviewed in the Sprint Review and have already been merged into Main. Therefore, at the end of the Sprint they will already be in production.



### üìù How to Subscribe to an Issue?

**1 - Choose Priority:**
- Select an issue based on its priority and your availability.

**2 - Assign to Yourself:**
- In the 'Assignees' field, add your name to indicate that you are responsible for the task.

**3 - Move to "In Progress":**
- Drag the card to the "In Progress" column on the Kanban board.

**4 - Complete the Task:**
- After finishing the work, move the card to "In Review".

**5 - Review the Task:**
- If necessary, mark the review stage as "To Review" for possible corrections.

After this, your code will be evaluated. If any corrections are needed, it will be marked as "To Correct" and you will be notified. If everything is fine, it will be merged into the main branch and marked as "Merged".


# Como fazer um Pull Riquest?

Levando em considera√ß√£o que j√° tenha feito o clone do projeto e que j√° esteja rodando em sua m√°quina. Antes de come√ßar a fazer altera√ß√µes, abra o terminal, digite os comandos e crie uma branch para trabalhar. certifique-se de que esteja na raiz do projeto.

### 1 - Crie uma nova Branch:
para uma melhor indentifica√ß√£o, use o padr√£o "iss#" + "n√∫mero da issue no kanban" para nomear a branch [ ex: iss#09 ].

    Caso voc√™ v√° trabalhar sozinho nessa branch, use o seguinte comando e siga para o passo 2:

        git chekout -b <nome-da-branch>


    Caso voc√™ queira trabalhar a partir de uma branch remota j√° existente, use o comando abaixo e siga para o passo 3:

        git checkout -b <nome-da-branch> origin/<nome-da-branch-remota>


### 2 - Verifique se tem atualiza√ß√µes na branch remota dev:
isso √© importante para que voc√™ come√ße a trabalhar alinhado com as atualiza√ß√µes da branch remota dev.

    git pull origin dev


### 3 - Fa√ßa as Altera√ß√µes: 

Agora, fa√ßa as altera√ß√µes necess√°rias no c√≥digo.

### 4 - Commit das Altera√ß√µes: 
Ap√≥s realizar as altera√ß√µes, voc√™ precisa adicionar e commitar as mudan√ßas. Utilize os seguintes comandos:
    
    git add .
    git commit -m "Descri√ß√£o das altera√ß√µes feitas"

### Envie para o Reposit√≥rio remoto: 
Agora, envie as altera√ß√µes para o seu reposit√≥rio remoto usando o comando:

        git push origin <nome-da-branch>
    
Caso a branch j√° esteja criada no reposit√≥rio remoto, ir√° atualiza-la e n√£o precisa fazer mais nada, caso n√£o esteja criada, ir√° criar uma nova branch com esse nome.

### Criando o Pull Request:
Ao realizar o push, caso seja uma branch nova no reposit√≥rio remoto, ir√° aparecer no terminal um link
    
    1 - Clique nele para ser direcionado para a p√°gina de pull request.

    2 - No campo "base repository" selecione o "projeto codexjr-dev/dashboard-codex-api", no caso do reposit√≥rio do repositorio backend, para o repositorio web, selecione "projeto codexjr-dev/dashboard-codex-web".

    3 - No campo "base" selecione a branch "dev".

    4 - Copie o link da p√°gina em que voc√™ est√°.

    5 - Aperte no bot√£o de Pull Request.

    6 - Abra sua Issue no quadro Kanban e cole nos coment√°rios o link copiado acima.
