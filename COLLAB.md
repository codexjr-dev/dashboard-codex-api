# üìåKanban

Kanban is a visual methodology used to manage projects, offering a clear view of task progress on a virtual board. In our project, it was used to control the workflow from idea to completion. The table has columns representing different stages of the process. Each task is represented by a card that moves between columns as it progresses. Allowing a clear view of the status of each task, making it easier to identify possible problems and plan the next steps.

## How each column works in Kanban

### üÜï New
In this column, we record Issues without complete detail. We haven't done the description and priority mapping yet. They wait to be evaluated and prioritized before being moved to the next step.

### üìã Backlog
The Issues in this column have been prioritized and have priority mapping, but have not yet been voted on for difficulty. They wait for the availability of resources or the completion of other activities to move forward.


### üìù Ready
Here, the Issues were noted in detail, mapped, voted on and judged important for the current Sprint. They are ready to go and all the necessary resources are available.


### üöÄ In Progress
At this stage, Issues are being actively worked on. Each team member can sign off on a task, even if they are just studying about it. If for some reason the task cannot be completed, it can be returned to the Ready column.

### üîç In Review
The Issues in this column have been completed and are undergoing a final review before acceptance to be merged into the dev branch. This is important to ensure the work meets established standards and requirements.
 
### ‚úÖ Done
In this final stage, the Issues were finalized, reviewed in the Sprint Review and have already been merged into Main. Therefore, at the end of the Sprint they will already be in production.



### üìù How to Subscribe to an Issue?

**1 - Choose Priority:**
- Select an issue based on its priority and your availability.

**2 - Assign to Yourself:**
- In the 'Assignees' field, add your name to indicate that you are responsible for the task.

**3 - Move to "In Progress":**
- Drag the card to the "In Progress" column on the Kanban board.

**4 - Complete the Task:**
- After finishing the work, move the card to "In Review".

**5 - Review the Task:**
- If necessary, mark the review stage as "To Review" for possible corrections.

After this, your code will be evaluated. If any corrections are needed, it will be marked as "To Correct" and you will be notified. If everything is fine, it will be merged into the main branch and marked as "Merged".


# How to do a Pull Riquest?

Taking into account that you have already cloned the project and that it is already running on your machine. Before you start making changes, open the terminal, type the commands and create a branch to work on. make sure it is in the root of the project.

### 1 - Create a new Branch:
for better identification, use the pattern "iss#" + "issue number in kanban" to name the branch [ex: iss#09].

     If you are going to work alone on this branch, use the following command and go to step 2:

         git chekout -b <branch-name>


     If you want to work from an existing remote branch, use the command below and go to step 3:

         git checkout -b <branch-name> origin/<remote-branch-name>


### 2 - Check if there are updates in the remote dev branch:
This is important so that you can start working in line with updates to the remote dev branch.

     git pull origin dev


### 3 - Make the Changes:

Now, make the necessary changes to the code.

### 4 - Commit Changes:
After making the changes, you need to add and commit the changes. Use the following commands:
    
     git add .
     git commit -m "Description of changes made"

### 5 - Upload to Remote Repository:
Now, push the changes to your remote repository using the command:

         git push origin <branch-name>
    
If the branch is already created in the remote repository, it will update it and you don't need to do anything else, if it is not created, it will create a new branch with that name.

### 6 - Creating the Pull Request:
When pushing, if it is a new branch in the remote repository, a link will appear on the terminal
    
     1 - Click on it to be directed to the pull request page.

     2 - In the "base repository" field, select the "codexjr-dev/dashboard-codex-api project", in the case of the backend repository repository, for the web repository, select "codexjr-dev/dashboard-codex-web project".

     3 - In the "base" field select the "dev" branch.

     4 - Copy the link of the page you are on.

     5 - Press the Pull Request button.

     6 - Open your Issue on the Kanban board and paste the link copied above in the comments.
